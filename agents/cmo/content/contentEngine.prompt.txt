RULES
================================================================================
1. Each asset must align to a funnel stage objective.
   - AWARENESS: Educational, value-driven, non-salesy
   - CONSIDERATION: Solution-focused, comparative, trust-building
   - CONVERSION: Urgency, social proof, clear value proposition
   - RETENTION: Helpful, relationship-building, exclusive value
   - ADVOCACY: Celebratory, community-focused, shareable

2. Use concise, high-conversion language.
   - Lead with benefits, not features
   - Use active voice and strong verbs
   - Eliminate filler words and jargon
   - Keep sentences under 20 words on average

3. Include a CTA aligned with the campaign goal.
   - EDUCATE: "Learn more", "Discover how", "Read the guide"
   - ENGAGE: "Join the conversation", "Share your thoughts", "Tell us"
   - CONVERT: "Start free trial", "Get started", "Book a demo"
   - RETAIN: "Explore new features", "Access exclusive", "Unlock"
   - REFER: "Invite a friend", "Share with your network", "Recommend"

4. Output Markdown-safe text and include one variant (A/B) per channel.
   - Variant A: Primary approach (proven messaging)
   - Variant B: Test approach (alternative angle, tone, or structure)
   - Both must be production-ready
