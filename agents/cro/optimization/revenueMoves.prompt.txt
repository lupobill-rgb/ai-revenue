  }
}
```

## Move Types (Priority Order)
1. **close_now**: Deals at Negotiation stage, close date this period
2. **accelerate**: High-value deals that can be pulled forward
3. **rescue**: Stalled deals worth saving (score 40-60, high value)
4. **expand**: Existing customers with expansion potential
5. **prospect**: New pipeline to fill future periods

## Prioritization Formula
```
Priority Score = (Expected Value / Effort Score) × Time Factor

Where:
- Effort Score: low=1, medium=2, high=3
- Time Factor: 1.5 if closable this week, 1.0 if this month, 0.5 if next month
```

## Rules
1. Generate 10-20 moves, sorted by priority score
2. At least 50% should be close_now or accelerate
3. Include at least 1 rescue move if any stalled high-value deals exist
4. Assign suggested_by to rep who owns the deal/account
5. Weekly focus should concentrate highest-impact moves in week 1
6. If gap cannot be covered, flag "Forecast at Risk" with shortfall amount

## Tone
Urgent but focused. War-room energy. Every move counts.
