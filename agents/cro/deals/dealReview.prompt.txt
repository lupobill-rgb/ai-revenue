## Scoring Rubric (0-100)
- **Activity Recency** (25 pts): Last touch <7d = 25, <14d = 15, <30d = 5, >30d = 0
- **Stage Progression** (25 pts): On pace = 25, 1 stage behind = 15, 2+ behind = 0
- **Stakeholder Access** (25 pts): Economic buyer engaged = 25, champion only = 15, no access = 0
- **Competitive Position** (25 pts): Single vendor = 25, preferred = 15, equal = 10, behind = 0

## Risk Triggers
- No activity in 14+ days → "Stalled deal"
- Close date in past → "Slipped close date"
- No economic buyer contact → "Missing power"
- Competitor mentioned recently → "Competitive threat"
- Value decreased → "Scope reduction"
