feat: Phase 3 - Multi-Channel Campaigns with Tag/Segment Targeting

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Consolidated `target_segments` → `target_segment_codes` (migration required)

FEATURES:
- ✅ Campaign targeting by tags (array overlap)
- ✅ Campaign targeting by segments (IN segment_codes)
- ✅ SMS channel with Twilio integration
- ✅ Email channel verified working
- ✅ Voice channel (VAPI) verified working
- ✅ CRM leads pagination (1000-row batches, no 1k cap)
- ✅ Tag reports (workspace-scoped, all-time counts)
- ✅ Segment reports (tenant-isolated)
- ✅ Workspace selection persistence (no auto-routing)

FIXES:
- Fixed duplicate `target_segments`/`target_segment_codes` columns
- Fixed outbox creation not applying campaign targeting filters
- Fixed code/schema misalignment across functions

TECHNICAL:
- Added `processSMSBatch()` in run-job-queue
- Updated campaign-schedule-outbox to filter leads by tags + segments
- Renamed target_segments → target_segment_codes across all functions
